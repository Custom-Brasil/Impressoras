There are two ways to set the log verbosity level.

To modify log settings you can create a key in regedit with the following steps:

1) Open regedit

2) Create the key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CUSTOM\CuCustomWndAPI"

3) In this key create a DWORD (32-bit) Value and call it "Verbosity"

4) Modify the key with a number between 0 and 7, it represents the followig log verbosity level:
	
	Level: 0 -> Log completely disabled
	Level: 1 -> Only log fatal errors
	Level: 2 -> (normal) Log errors. Program will continue
	Level: 3 -> Also log warning - something suspicious occured
	Level: 4 -> Also log hints and informational messages
	Level: 5 -> Log functions methods messages
	Level: 6 -> Log all messages, also debug messages. Use only if required
	Level: 7 -> Log all messages, also deep debug messages. Use only if required. Could slow down the communication


Otherwhise you can create a .cfg file in the same folder where the library is located.
This file must named as "CuCustomWndAPI.dll.cfg" and to set the verbosity log level you have to write:

[Log settings]
Verbosity=n

n is a number between 0 and 7 and define the verbosity log level.


IMPORTANT: If you declare both of these settings sytem you must know that only the .cfg file settings will be applied
